This Spring project is a simple social network application that allows users to manage their profiles, create posts, and interact with each other. 

Users can register, update their details (including profile picture, bio, and date of birth), and delete their accounts.

 Posts support captions, media uploads, likes, and nested comments, with options to set visibility as public or friends-only. 

Additionally, the platform provides basic CRUD operations for posts, likes, and comments, while the friend management service handles sending, accepting, rejecting, and blocking friend requests.
